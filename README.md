# Twitter_Prototype
This is a Prototype of a Twitter website using C++ where we can create an account and log into our account to view posts and create posts. 📝
Using this we can create multiple accounts for lots of users, only different user names are accepted. ✅
users signing up with the same name will be rejected. ❌
Users cannot upload videos or image formats but can tweet anything. ✒️
